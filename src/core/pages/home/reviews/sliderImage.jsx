    review: `Found ValuePrint by chance and probably one of the best customer services I've experienced. I've made multiple corporate bulk orders with ValuePrint and I'm beyond pleased with the quality and service rendered by Ricky. Very patient, accommodating, and helpful from start to end.

    Even if it's a large corporate order with a tight deadline (we're talking about QTY6,000 with 2 turnaround days), he'll always help to find a solution to make it happen. Highly recommend`,
